# FightClubManager

FightClubManager is a simple Python3 text-based game where you can manage a team of fighters and try to win a tournament
by making changes amongst the team.

- manage fighters, hire and fire, look at stats, etc
- play the fight with our fighters.
- fight season, tournament,fighters roll-up


This mini-project has been worked on for four days in my spare time, while consolidating my knowledge of OOP basics in python3.
